## **Evaluations** </br>
Recommend you open eval slots as much as you can, that way you get a couple of things out of it.

- You meet them 1 on 1 and get to know them more and their skillset.
- You get 1 eval point for every eval done.
- They explain their code to you, which helps you further understand the project. 
- You have a copy of their repo, which could help you figure out the logic to the code.

## How To Open Evaluation Slots

Step 1 - Head to the 42Intra page - intra.42.fr </br>
Step 2 - On the 42Intra page, click on Managed Slots in the Evaluations section. </br>
Step 3 - Click and drag open the evaluation slots you are free to evaluation other people's .c projects. </br>
Step 4 - You would know when you are book for an evaluation as it popus up on the 42Intra Dashboard states the following: </br>

You are evaluating someone on C00 (for example) in 30 mins (for example) and when it is less than 15 mins, it will show who exactly you are evaluating. 
</br>

This is for when you are evaluating someone else's C Project or they are evaluating you on your C Project and you can't seem to find them?
